# Project: Discord Bot


This repo contains a minimal working example of a Discord Bot for MP3 project for Intro to Engineering

The bot will be able to do simple but useful algebraic functions, as well as some basic math.

Functions

Equation: Find solutions for linear and quadratic equations. Takes is three arguments -- coefficients: a, b, c, such as from f(x)= ax^2+bx+c. If any of the coefficients is 0, it still has to be sent.

Linear_systems: Finds the values of x and y in the form of y = ax + b and y = cx + b

Plot: Finds y points for your polynomial function. Takes in arguments being coefficients of the polynomial with account on those, which are 0s. The last argument will be a value of x you are willing to solve for. 

Bonus functions

Add: Takes in an unlimited number of arguments and returns their sum. 

Subtract: Takes in two arguments and returns their difference. 

Multiply: Takes in two arguments and returns their product. 

Divide: Takes in two arguments and returns quotient.

add_and_subtract: takes in negative and positive arguments to solve. (ex. 12, 1, -10 = 12 + 1 -10 = 3)

Power: Takes in two arguments and returns the result of the first argument being raised to a power of the second argument.

Root: Takes in two arguments (a, n) and returns nth root of a.

(Note: For the above functions, only arguments with no variables will be taken)

Sqrt Simplifier: Takes in radicand as argument and returns algebraically simplified square root.

FUNctions

Sacrifice: It is time to sacrifice your gifts to the Great God... 

Hello: greets you.

Backstory: Find out more about the God and his story.

Sacrifice your problems, make life easier and Mort happier! Good luck, noble math hero!
