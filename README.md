This repo contains a minimal working example of a Discord Bot for MP3 project for Intro to Engineering

The bot (once completed) will be able to return understandable answers to simple equations.

Functions: 
Add     Takes in an unlimited number of arguments and returns their sum. 
Subtract     Takes in two arguments and retuns their difference.
Multiply     Takes in two arguments and returns their product. 
Divide      Takes in two arguments and returns quotient.
Power       Takes in two arguments and retuns the result of the first argument
             being raised to a power of the second argument.

            coefficients of the polynomial with account on those, which are 0s. 
            The last argument will be a value of x you are willing to solve for.
